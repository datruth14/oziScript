Ozi Script Documentation
Version: 0.5
Ozi Script is an easy-to-use web development framework designed to simplify both front-end and back-end web development. Built on modern development principles, it adopts a component-based architecture, where every element is a reusable component. Ozi Script ensures that your projects follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles for efficient coding.
Key Features
    • Component-Based Architecture:
Create reusable, modular components to improve scalability and maintainability of your app.
    • Progressive Web App (PWA) Capabilities:
Ozi Script apps are installable, work offline, and can access native device features like push notifications, contacts, and file storage.
    • Extensibility with Widgets and Plugins:
Easily enhance your app with pre-built widgets and plugins that offer powerful additional functionality.
    • Easy Setup and Development:
Ozi Script streamlines your workflow with a simple installation process and intuitive structure, helping you get started quickly.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
    • XAMPP (or any PHP server) 
    • Composer 
Step-by-Step Installation
    1. Verify PHP and Composer installation:
php --version  
composer --version  
Both commands should return the installed versions.
    2. Install Ozi Script:
composer create-project ozi/ozi_script projectName  
Replace projectName with your desired project name.
    3. Navigate to the project folder:
cd projectName  
    4. Start the development server:
php ozi serve  
By default, the server runs on port 3000. To use a custom port, specify it like this:
php ozi serve 5000  
    5. Open the app in your browser:
        ◦ For default: http://localhost:3000 
        ◦ For custom: http://localhost:5000 
Congratulations! Ozi Script is successfully installed.
